[OpenAI](https://openai.com) has emailed customers notifying them of the discontinuation of Codex, their model for code languages.

The message titled "The transition from Codex to GPT-3.5"

> On March 23rd (2023), we will discontinue support for the Codex API. All customers will have to transition to a different model. Codex was initially introduced as a free limited beta in 2021, and has maintained that status to date. Given the advancements of our newest GPT-3.5 models for coding tasks, we will no longer be supporting Codex and encourage all customers to transition to GPT-3.5-turbo.

## Results

In my own experience, I've been using GPT-3 `text-davinci-003` over Codex `code-davinci-002` or `code-cushman-001` and getting better code results via prompts.

I had assummed that Codex performed best with IDE integrations for autocomplete and embeddings.

## Github Copilot

What does this mean for [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)? They clearly state they are using the Codex model. Or did the transition already happen? Did anyone notice the improvement?

## Speed

Another example of the fast pace of this space.

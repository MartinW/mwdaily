# Trello Workflows

[Trello](http://www.trello.com) is a powerful tool for managing projects and workflows. One of its greatest strengths is its user interface, which makes creating and tracking workflows a breeze.

Whether you're managing a team of developers, keeping track of marketing campaigns, or just trying to stay organized, Trello's intuitive drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to create and modify workflows to suit your needs.

## Boards, cards and tasks

With Trello, you can create a board for each project, and then add lists and cards to represent each step in your workflow. Cards can be assigned to team members, given due dates, and tagged with labels to help you keep track of what needs to be done.

As tasks are completed, they can be moved to the next list in the workflow, giving you a visual representation of progress and helping you stay on top of what's happening.

# Trello Integration

## Automations

Trello integrates with many automation tools, including [Zapier](http://www.zapier.com) and [Make](http://www.make.com), allowing you to automate your workflows even further. With these tools, you can create triggers that automatically move cards from one list to another, update due dates, send notifications, and more.

## Integrations

[Trello also integrates with GitHub](https://zapier.com/apps/github/integrations/trello), allowing you to create new issues, create new files and pull requests directly from Trello cards. This integration is especially useful for development teams, as it allows you to track issues and pull requests alongside your project's workflow. Additionally, you can link to GitHub files and repositories from within Trello cards, making it easy to access code and documentation. With this integration, you can keep your development workflow organized and efficient.

# Custom Integration

## OAuth and API’s

OAuth and API’s are also supported, allowing you to authenticate users and access their data securely. With these features, you can integrate Trello and Github with your own applications or services, and build custom workflows that meet your specific needs.

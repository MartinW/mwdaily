The confusing headline [GPTs are GPTs](https://openai.com/research/gpts-are-gpts) has just made sense.

Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models are now general-purpose technologies (GPTs)

From the [abstract](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130):

> We investigate the potential implications of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models and related technologies on the U.S. labor market. Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their correspondence with GPT capabilities, incorporating both human expertise and classifications from GPT-4. Our findings indicate that approximately 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of GPTs, while around 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted. The influence spans all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure. Notably, the impact is not limited to industries with higher recent productivity growth. We conclude that Generative Pre-trained Transformers exhibit characteristics of general-purpose technologies (GPTs), suggesting that as these models could have notable economic, social, and policy implications.

Also of note:

> Despite their limitations, LLMs are becoming increasingly integrated into specialized applications in areas such as writing assistance, coding, and legal research, paving the way for businesses and individuals to adopt GPTs more widely.

Then:

> However, specialized workflows—including tooling, software, or human-in-the-loop systems—can help address these shortcomings by incorporating domain-specific expertise.

Bizarrely, making no sense in context or out of context:

> In other words, while it's true that on its own GPT-4 does not "know what time it is," it's easy enough to give it a watch.

Occupations with highest exposure:

- Interpreters and Translators
- Poets, Lyricists and Creative Writers
- Animal Scientists
- Survey Researchers Writers and Authors
- Interpreters and Translators
- Public Relations Specialists
- Mathematicians
- Tax Preparers
- Financial Quantitative Analysts Writers and Authors
- Web and Digital Interface Designers
- Correspondence Clerks
- Blockchain Engineers
- Court Reporters and Simultaneous Captioners
- Proofreaders and Copy Markers
- Accountants and Auditors
- News Analysts, Reporters, and Journalists
- Legal Secretaries and Administrative Assistants
- Clinical Data Managers
- Climate Change Policy Analysts

> Exposure percentages indicate the share of an occupation's task that are exposed to GPTs or GPT-powered software, where exposure is defined as driving a reduction in time it takes to complete the task by at least 50%.
> As such, occupations listed in this table are those where we estimate that GPTs and GPT-powered software are able to save workers a significant amount of time completing a large share of their tasks, but it does not necessarily suggest that their tasks can be fully automated by these technologies.

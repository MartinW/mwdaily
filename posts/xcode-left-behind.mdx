Promotion: IntelliGen is your AI coding partner for Xcode.

Prediction: Apple is going to get left behind in this latest AI wave. Microsoft is going to be the big winner.

## Apple Delays

iOS, MacOS and Xcode are all going to get left behind in 2023. I do not expect any WWDC announcements of ‘release’ software for the remainder of 2023. I do not believe they have the partnerships or capacity to move at speed for the typical Fall release of major OS upgrades. It is unlikely that Xcode upgrades would happen as a priority.

## Apple Developer Ecosystem

While Xcode is a great developer tool, Apple does not have a great reputation for extending that support to the rest of the development process.

Xcode has for a long time been restricted by developer extensions. The Apple sandbox everything for privacy and security approach has been applied too rigidly to the Wild West that is the developer tools market.

Xcode Cloud was a long time in the making, had a slow rollout to developers and was a long time in beta.

The iOS developer community relies on Fastlane, an open source community project, for managing app releases.

## Microsoft Developer Ecosystem

Microsoft has close links with OpenAI, owns Github and makes VSCode. That’s a huge share of all parts of the developer ecosystem.

Microsoft has AI in the cloud, in your meetings, in your documents, in your IDE and on your command line. There are no signs that Apple has anything to match with this.

## WWDC 2023

WWDC 2023 will be eagerly awaited. But primarily to help with the decision of which other developer tools I’ll be using for the next 12 - 18 months.

- Bug was discovered in the open-source library, Asyncio redis-py client for Redis Cluster.
- allowed some users to see titles from another active user’s chat history.
- also possible that the first message of a newly-created conversation was visible in someone else’s chat history if both users were active around the same time.
- unintentional visibility of payment-related information of 1.2% of the ChatGPT Plus subscribers who were active during a specific nine-hour window.
  - it was possible for some users to see another active user’s first and last name, email address, payment address, the last four digits (only) of a credit card number, and credit card expiration date.
  - Complex scenario in which payment details could have been seen.

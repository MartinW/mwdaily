OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company feels "awful", but the "significant" error had now been fixed. [BBC][2]

“We had a significant issue in ChatGPT due to a bug in an open source library, for which a fix has now been released and we have just finished validating,”
“A small percentage of users were able to see the titles of other users’ conversation history.” [Altman tweeted][3]. [CNBC][4]

A less opaque version is on the [incident report][5].

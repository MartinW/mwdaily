Picked up via [BBC][2], Bill Gates published a [note on AI][3]. He’s writing in his philanthropist role, but there is still a heavy lean on his Microsoft spokesperson role.

He's been through a lot of changes including missing the Internet so this is a bold statement:

> I knew I had just seen the most important advance in technology since the graphical user interface.

Relating to productivity:

> Advances in AI will enable the creation of a personal agent … This will both improve your work on the tasks you want to do and free you from the ones you don’t want to do.

The brokenness of AI may be fixed sooner than we think:

> There are other issues, such as AIs giving wrong answers to math problems because they struggle with abstract reasoning. But none of these are fundamental limitations of artificial intelligence. Developers are working on them, and I think we’re going to see them largely fixed in less than two years and possibly much faster.

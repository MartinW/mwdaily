Trello can be used as a tool to visualize the user flow of your app. It can be used to represent the flow of data, tasks or actions through an app.

You can create boards, lists, and cards to represent the different stages and components of your app idea.

## Internal Automation

Trello Automations can be used to power workflows. Rules and action buttons can trigger actions on cards and boards.

Trello Power-Ups enable integration with a catalogue of supported tools.

## External Automation

Additional workflow tools like Zapier and Make can be used to extend the interactions.

## Example

### ChatGPT Article Flow

This flow in Make will process a Trello card with the title e.g. “Create 5 suggestions for articles about learning to code”. The response from ChatGPT will be split into the 5 suggestions and created on new Trello cards.

If the suggestions are appropriate, they can dragged to the “Create” column in Trello, where another workflow will send them to ChatGPT and attach the response to the description.
